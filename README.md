Some stuff about Reedoo
=======================

The source code of the Reedoo Programming Langauge. Reedoo is a brand new kind of programming language that aims to be everything that great language should be. The aims of Reedoo are:
  1. A language that is fast, safe and secure
  2. Something that is fun to program in and easy to learn
  3. Work across all major platforms on all major processor architectures
  4. Have a large standard library
  5. Be open source to allow anyone to help or even just see how it works.


So how does Reedoo work?
========================

Reedoo runs off of the Reedoo Virtual Machine. Reedoo is written in RPython, a subset of the Python language that can be converted into C source code and compiled to provide excellent performance with ease. The hope is that Reedoo will be one of the fastest languages around when it's finished.

Reedoo source code is stored in .rd files. The .rd files are converted into .rda files by the Reedoo Compiler. Then the .rda files are passed to the Reedoo Assembler where they are converted into .rdc files, which can be executed by the Reedoo Virtual Machine.
