# Example of single-line comments in Reedoo
# When the parser sees a # symbol it assumes
# that the rest of the line is a comment. This
# shows how comments work. You can even include 
# variables, if statements, print statements etc ...
# in a comment an Reedoo will ignore everything when it 
# parses the file.
