# Below is an example of how variables are created in Reedoo,
# Reedoo supports dynamic typing, so %test can be a number at
# the beginning of the program and a string at the end of it.
# Variables are prepended with percent-signs, just like PHP prepends
# variable names with the dollar-sign.

%test = 10 + 5 * -(6 * 3)

print %test # Prints -80

%test = "Hello World"

print %test # Prints "Hello World"
